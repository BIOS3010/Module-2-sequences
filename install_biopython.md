### Install Biopython

The easiest way to install Biopython is to use the builtin Python package manageer (PiP).

If you have Python installed on your system, you usually also have PiP installed as a module, and can install Biopython executing this command in the terminal:

```
python3 -m pip install biopython
```

Note: If your the command you use to run python is `python` and not `python3`, you will need to swap `python3` with `python` in the command above.


#### Check that the installation was successful
Type `python3` (or `python`) on the command line to go into an interactive python shell.

Type `import Bio`.

If no errors are shown, Bipython is installed. Type `exit()` to leave the interactive python shell.
