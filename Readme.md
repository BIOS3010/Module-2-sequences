# Module 2 - Sequences

In this module, we will use Python and the [Biopython](https://biopython.org/) package to represent and analyse DNA sequences.
## 2.1 Setup today's exercises
In the exercises last week, Windows-users installed the Gitbash terminal application. Mac (and Linux) users already have a Terminal application installed in their systems.

Open your Terminal application (Gitbash for Windows users) and copy-paste the following:
```bash
cd ~/BIOS3010/
git clone https://github.com/BIOS3010/Module-2-sequences.git
cd Module-2-sequences
```
This will go to the directory we created last week (`BIOS3010`). The `git clone` command downloads the exercises for today, and then we enter the directory called `Module-2-sequences`
